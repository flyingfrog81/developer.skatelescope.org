Workflows/Pipelines and Processing Components

SDP Workflow library
++++++++++++++++++++

The SDP workflow library is a high-level interface for writing workflows. Its
goal is to provide abstractions to enable the developer to express the
high-level organisation of a workflow without needing to interact directly with
the low-level interfaces such as the SDP configuration library. More details can be
found `here <https://developer.skatelescope.org/projects/sdp-workflow/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_

SDP Workflows and Processing functions
