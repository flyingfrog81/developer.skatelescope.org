Science Pipeline Workflows
--------------------------

The science pipeline workflows define the processing to be done by SDP to
generate the data products. They express the high-level organisation of the
processing, which is carried out by execution engines and processing functions.
Details of the realtime and and batch workflows, and instructions on how to
develop a workflow can be found here.

Workflow Library
++++++++++++++++

The workflow library is a high-level interface for writing workflows. Its goal
is to provide abstractions to enable the developer to define a workflow without
needing to interact directly with the low-level interfaces such as the
configuration library.
