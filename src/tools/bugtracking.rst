The SKA software projects are developed by teams, each of which manages a team backlog. 
Defects which are identified during the development phases should be tracked in teams'

BUG TRACKING SYSTEM
-------------------

A Jira project is set up where bugs can be logged which have no clear ownership in terms of teams and products. 
Bugs identified in the integration environment can be logged against this bug tracking system.
