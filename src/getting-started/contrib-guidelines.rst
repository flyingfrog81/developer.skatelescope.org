Contributing to the SKA
***********************

We're delighted that you'd like to contribute to an SKA project. First of all, please read our :doc:`/policies/code-of-conduct`, which sets out our expectations for behaviour when working on the SKA. Since you're most likely here to work with our repositories, you should proably read our guide to :doc:`/tools/git`. 

The advice provided here is general; please look at the documentation for the repository you wish to commit to to check out the specific policies. For example, if you wish to :doc:`/contributor/contribute`, you'll need to read the linked page. If a specific policy contradicts the general advice, please follow the policy for the relevant repository over the guidance provided here. Note that at the moment, not all repositories have good processes to deal with merge requests from forks of that repo. 

SKA repositories follow feature based :ref:`branching-policy` with Merge Request for code review and integration. Everyone is welcome to clone/fork the repository and open a Merge Request for contribution. The Merge request will be reviewed by the repository maintainers. Please make sure you follow the contribution guidelines defined here and in the repository as well.

Please read the :doc:`/tools/codeguides` for the language you're working with; you'll need to adhere to those standards. Many repositories will perform PEP-8 or similar linting checks. If you're working on documentation for any repository, we use ReadtheDocs, using the Sphinx documentation generator, which uses `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#>`_. 

For documentation, we recommend that file and directory names do *not* use underscores, but use hyphens. We recommend using Thomas Cokelaer's `heading syntax <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#headings>`-. We suggest updating pages as you work on them to adopt this style. 

Any images you add to documentation should have adequate contrast. A good test is to print images out in black and white; if they're still legible, the contrast is likely to be acceptable for people with low visio. All images should have alt-text added, unless the same information can be obtained from a figure caption. We recommend reading a `guide to writing good alt-text <https://brailleworks.com/how-to-write-amazing-alt-text/>`-.

Thank you for reading; we hope that you're able to contribute to the SKA.
