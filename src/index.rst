SKA telescope developer portal
------------------------------

Welcome to the `Square Kilometre Array <http://www.skatelescope.org>`_ software 
documentation portal. Wheather you are a developer involved in SKA or you are 
simply one of our many users, all of our software processes and projects are 
documented in this portal.

Scope
=====

This documentation applies to the bridging phase of the SKA project, with first
contributions effectively happening in July 2018. 
Part of the bridging phase goals will be to consolidate and enrich this portal 
with more detailed information. It is thus anticipated that in this phase 
the change rate of the documentation will be very frequent.
